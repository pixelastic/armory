When piercing their target, the acid will eat flesh, worsening the wound. They are available in the whole [[:Category:Baldur's Gate series|''Baldur's Gate'' series]].\n\n{{description|This arrow is coated in acid. When it strikes an enemy, it not only pierces flesh but also eats it away, enlarging and deepening the wound.|'''Acid Arrow +1'''}}\n\n==Statistics==\nCompared with a normal [[arrow]], the [[Magical item|magical]] acid [[:Category:Arrows|variant]] not only comes with a by 1 increased basic [[missile damage]], dealing 2 to 7 points of it – it may additionally inflict [[acid damage]] to their target, unless blocked by [[magic resistance]]. The amount of this [[elemental damage]] differs by [[:Category:Games|game]]: 2 to 12 points in ''[[Baldur's Gate (game)|Baldur's Gate I]]'', opposed to only 1 to 3 points in ''[[Baldur's Gate II]]''.\n\nAlthough this [[ammunition]] aids the [[Bows|bowman]] in [[THAC0|hitting]] their target by granting a bonus of 1 throughout the [[:Category:Baldur's Gate series|series]], it counts as [[enchanted]] only in the ''Enhanced Editions'', with a level of 1.\n:''See [[#Hits creatures|below]] for an overview which [[creatures]] can be hit.''\n\nAs for other arrows, [[cleric]]s and [[druid]]s of all [[class]] combinations, as well as [[mage]]s and [[sorcerer]]s, aren't able to use them. While [[cavalier]]s and [[kensai]] also aren't allowed to fire a bow, they at least can help carrying some quivers of these – something, [[monk]]s can only do in the original ''Baldur's Gate II''.\n\nThey are sold for a basic price of {{gp|50}} on the [[Sword Coast]], but are worth only {{gp|20}} in [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]].\n\n==Locations==\n===''The Black Pits''===\n*Sold by [[Devlin Taralon]] from ''Tier 2'' {{infinitely}}\n\n===''Baldur's Gate''===\n*Sold by [[Thalantyr the Conjurer]] in [[High Hedge ]]\n*Sold by [[Halbazzer Drin]] in [[Sorcerous Sundries]]\n\n===''Tales of the Sword Coast''===\n{{SectionStub}}\n\n===''Siege of Dragonspear''===\n{{SectionStub}}\n\n===''Shadows of Amn''===\n{{SectionStub}}\n\n===''Throne of Bhaal''===\n{{SectionStub}}\n\n===''Gladiators of Thay''===\n{{SectionStub}}\n\n==Gameplay==\n*{{BG2 16}} The [[acid damage]] component is decreased to a quarter in ''[[Baldur's Gate II]]'', along with a reduced price.\n\n===Hits creatures===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! style=\"height:40px\" | \n! {{BG}}{{BGTotSC}}\n! {{BGIISoA}}{{BGIIToB}}\n! {{BGEE}}{{BGSoD}}\n! {{BGIIEESoA}}{{BGIIEEToB}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[:Category:Immune to non-enchanted weapons|Immune to enchantment level 0]]\n| \n| \n| ×\n| ×\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[:Category:Immune to magical weapons|Immune to magical weapons]]\n| \n| \n| \n| \n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[:Category:Immune to normal weapons|Immune to normal weapons]]\n| ×\n| ×\n| ×\n| ×\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[Protection From Normal Missiles|Protected from normal missiles]]\n| ×\n| ×\n| ×\n| ×\n|-\n|}\n[[Category:Non-enchanted weapons]]\n[[Category:+1 weapons]]\n[[Category:Random treasure]]"
