In addition to strengthening the mind against the guile of others, the sword absorbs life energy from an opponent with each successful hit, healing the user. Dabbar considered it a failure of his officers if he returned from battle in less than perfect health, and as the rest of the company watched, he would administer beatings until fully healed.}}\n[[Category:Long Swords]]\n\n\n\n[[Category:Articles with redlinks]]\n[[Category:Infobox Incomplete]]"
