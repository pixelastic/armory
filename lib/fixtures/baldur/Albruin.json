Later it was added also in [[Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition]], where it can be looted from Simmeon (who is part of [[Dorn Il-Khan]]'s [[Dorn Il-Khan (quest)|quest]]) and also counts as a silver weapon, making it useful against [[Greater Wolfwere|greater wolfweres]].\n\n==Locations==\n===[[Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition]]===\n*[[Wyrm's Crossing]] - Loot from [[Simmeon]] (part of Dorn's storyline)\n===[[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn]]===\n*[[Underdark]] - Reward from wizard [[Raevilin Strathi]] if you free him from [[Imprisonment]] in the sphere and cure him from madness with a [[Heal]] spell after he attacks you\n\n==Description==\n{{Quote|Basalin was a large man, rumored, far from his hearing, to be a werebear. He long wielded the sword Albruin in the protection of his village, slaying giant spiders that plagued the area. The sword protected him from their poison and also allowed him to see invisible [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizards]] who controlled some of the more fantastic variants. The reason for their enmity is unknown.}}\n\n==Gallery==\n\u003Cgallery spacing=\"small\"\u003E\nAlbruin item artwork BG2.png\nAlbruin item icon BG2.png\n\u003C/gallery\u003E\n[[Category:Bastard Swords]]"
