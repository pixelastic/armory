However, it's missing the plate's high modifiers against certain types of [[physical damage]]. Upon equipping, the armor adds a bonus of 1 to all [[saving throw]]s.\n\n== Location ==\n* This armor can be chosen as one possible reward for [[Gain the services of Sir Sarles for the temple|gaining the services of Sir Sarles for a temple]] if you are a cleric.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n* The low weight of 15 lb and the low [[strength]] requirement of this armor make it a good choice for a less mighty character, such as [[Viconia DeVir|Viconia]].\n\n== Description ==\n{{Description|This was the armor of [[Seffer Ekr]], and a sign of the goddess [[Mielikki|Mielikii]]'s{{sic}} favor.  She had rewarded the [[ranger]]'s loyalty with the promise that he would never die in battle, and he defied death for many years, holding [[orc]]ish hordes back from his home forest.  A heart attack claimed him when his time was done, not an enemy's blade.}}\n==External links==\n*{{FRW|Armor of faith}}\n[[Category:Articles with redlinks]]\n[[Category:Medium Armor]]\n[[Category:Infobox upgrade]]"
