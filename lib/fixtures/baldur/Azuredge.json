The weapon deals 1d6 points of damage and it has no bonus to [[THAC0]], but the weapon deals 1d6 +4 points of damage to the undead, who must make saving throw with a -4 penalty or be destroyed instantly. This enchantment is similar to the enchantment the [[Mace of Disruption]] has, though it cannot be upgraded to protect against level drain.\n\n==Location==\nSold exclusively by [[Bernard]] in his improved store. {{Bernard improved}}\n\n==Description==\n{{quote|Azuredge Axe +3:\nGulen Rockfire, Slayer of Undead, crafted this powerful throwing axe expressly for reinforcing his claim to his namesake. Blessed by a cross-section of gods, this weapon does phenomenal damage against creatures unwisely rebelling against their deceased status, and can potentially destroy them in a single blow. Obviously Gulen no longer carries Azuredge, and it is rumored that he died fighting a powerful vampire years ago, only to rise as one himself.Â This may have softened his stance regarding the undead, at the very least prompting a change of name.}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{FRW}}\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Throwing axes]]"
