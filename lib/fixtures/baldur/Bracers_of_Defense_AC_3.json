As for all bracers of defense, if the character is already wearing armor whith a better AC, this item will have no effect. In [[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn]] they have a weight of 1 lbs, though the description reads 2. This is fixed to match the description in [[Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition]].\n\n{{Description|Grinning Glen, the Knight of Fools, wore these bracers while competing in jousting tourneys. With his skill, charm, and bravado -- no man other than he would joust without armor --  he soon became a favorite to the ladies that watched the events. Too much of a favorite it would seem, for one afternoon he was caught frolicking with a knight's betrothed.  A challenge was issued, but in his rush Glen forget to don his bracers. Glen died with a confused grin on his face as the knight's sword struck him, never knowing his own folly.|[[Bracers of Defense AC 3]]|header=yes}}\n\n==Locations==\n* Sold exclusively by [[Ribald Barterman]] in his [[Adventurer Mart]], [[Waukeen's Promenade]]\n\n===Undroppable / Unstealable===\n* Several fellow gladiators in [[The Black Pits II: Gladiators of Thay]] wear them, but never drop them.\n* [[Aran Linvail]] also likes to keep them for himself as does [[Degardan]]\n* And finally, [[Nyalee]] in [[Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal]] is also very fond of them."
