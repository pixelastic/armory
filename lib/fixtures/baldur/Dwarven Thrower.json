It can be thrown 20&nbsp;ft and it will return to the owner. The weapon inflicts 2d4 +3 points of crushing damage and it has +3 bonus to THAC0. It deals an additional +8 damage when fighting against ogres and giants. This hammer has a weight of 4&nbsp;lbs and a speed factor of 1.\n\n{{Description|header=yes|This hammer -- not to be confused with the elven made Dwarf Thrower -- is only usable by dwarves. In the capable hands of a dwarven warrior the hammer may be thrown at an opponent. The magic in the hammer draws it back to the hand of its wielder. If it hits an opponent it does double the normal damage that a hammer would normally do.  Against giants and ogres the hammer does an additional +8 damage, due to the special hatred that dwarves hold against these races.|[[Dwarven Thrower]]}}\n\n==Locations==\nIt's sold exclusively by an [[Merchant (Trademeet Market)|unnamed merchant]] after the genie problems have been solved.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=small captionalign=center>\nDwarven_Thrower_+3_Item_artwork_BG2.png|Original BG2 Artwork<ref name=\"bg2soa-w-tob\"/>\nCHAMM0600000.PNG|Original BG2 Artwork (transparent)<ref name=\"bg2-source-unknown\"/>\nDwarven_Thrower_+3_Item_icon_BG2.png|Original BG2 item icon<ref name=\"bg2soa-w-tob\"/>\n</gallery>\n\n{{References|refs=\n<ref name=\"bg2soa-w-tob\">Baldur’s Gate II: Shadows of Amn with Throne of Bhaal expansion pack, version 2.5.26498 (2001) </ref>\n<ref name=\"bg2-source-unknown\">The image is believed to be from a Baldur's Gate II edition, but exact details are unknown</ref>\n|}}\n[[Category:Throwing hammers]]"
