While his position ensured that Ophyllis possessed many chests, he only used one to house his lungs, and it was in this particular chest the sword was placed. Ophyllis died an agonized, painful death, but not before he gave the sword to a <PRO_MANWOMAN> to whom he owed a deep personal debt. His mournful voice can still be heard by those who wield the blade.}}\n[[Category:Items in BG: SoD]]\n[[Category:New items in BG: SoD]]\n[[Category:Infobox upgrade]]"
