It was introduced in the ''[[Artorias of the Abyss]]'' DLC.\n\n{{Description\n|First paragraph  = This greatsword belonged to Lord Gwyn's Knight Artorias, who fell to the abyss.\n|Second paragraph = Swallowed by the Dark with its master, this sword is tainted by the abyss, and now its strength reflects its wielder's humanity.}}\n\n==Availability==\nThe Abyss Greatsword is created by [[Weapon Modification|ascending]] any [[Standard (Upgrade Path)|Standard]] +10 [[Greatswords (Dark Souls)|greatsword]], [[Ultra Greatswords|ultra greatsword]], [[Straight Swords|straight sword]] (other than the Broken Straight Sword or Straight Sword Hilt) or [[Daggers|dagger]] at the [[Giant Blacksmith]] in [[Anor Londo]] with the [[Soul of Artorias]] and 5,000 [[soul]]s.\n\n==Characteristics==\nCompared to its [[Greatsword of Artorias|pristine self]], the Abyss Greatsword has a distinct moveset, lower stat requirements, weighs one unit less, has a heavily deteriorated appearance, and deals purely physical damage. The strong attacks are reminiscent of those performed by [[Knight Artorias|Artorias]] himself.\n\nDespite requiring 18 [[Faith (Dark Souls)|Faith]] and [[Intelligence (Dark Souls)|Intelligence]], the Abyss Greatsword does not scale off of these parameters. This may discourage more specialized builds from utilizing this weapon.\n\nUnusual for a weapon, the Abyss Greatsword has fairly good [[Magic (Damage Type)|magic]] resistance, although most [[Shields|shields]] are still preferable.\n\nLike [[Chaos (Upgrade Path)|Chaos]] weapons, the Abyss Greatsword scales with [[Humanity Mechanic|Humanity]] (up to 10).\n\n==Moveset==\n{{Moveset\n| 1hWeak   = Horizontal slashes.\n| 1hStrong = Fast 720° counter-clockwise swing with high starting lag. May only hit each enemy once per attack, even if they are within reach of both spins.\n| 2hWeak   = Vertical swings.\n| 2hStrong = Player somersaults into the air before smashing the sword into the ground. High starting and ending lag. Can be parried despite what its airborne appearance suggests.\n| Jump     = Player jumps and swings the greatsword into the ground.\n| Run      = Spinning clockwise slash.\n| Roll     = Quick downward swing.\n| Kick     = Standard kick.\n| LhWeak   = Block.\n| LhStrong = Horizontal swing.\n}}\n\n==Upgrades==\n{{WeaponBox\n| Name = Abyss Greatsword\n| Type = Demon\n| Cost = 5,000\n| 160 | - | - | - | C | C | - | - | 40 | 50 | 40 | 40 | 38\n| 176 | - | - | - | C | C | - | - | 40 | 50 | 40 | 40 | 38\n| 192 | - | - | - | C | C | - | - | 40 | 50 | 40 | 40 | 38\n| 208 | - | - | - | C | C | - | - | 40 | 50 | 40 | 40 | 38\n| 224 | - | - | - | C | C | - | - | 40 | 50 | 40 | 40 | 38\n| 240 | - | - | - | C | C | - | - | 40 | 50 | 40 | 40 | 38\n}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery position=\"center\" captionalign=\"center\">\nAbyss GS in game.png\n</gallery>\n\n{{GreatswordsNav}}\n[[pl:Wielki miecz Otchłani]]\n[[Category:Dark Souls: Boss Soul Weapons]]\n[[Category:Artorias of the Abyss]]"
