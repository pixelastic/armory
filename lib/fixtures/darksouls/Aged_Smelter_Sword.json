While either soul can be traded, one must first defeat the Smelter Demon in the [[Iron Passage]] to access this trade.\n\n==Characteristics==\nVisually, its design is very similar to the [[Smelter Sword]]. The only difference is that it glows blue, as it deals Magic damage, as opposed to Fire damage.\n\nWhilst being one of the heaviest weapons in the game, as well as possessing a relatively slow moveset, the Aged Smelter Sword is quite powerful in the right hands. It also features a unique moveset, where each strong attack is a combustion-inducing strike, creating a small, fiery explosion when the sword makes contact. Strong attacks consume 10 durability each; this can be partially mitigated with use of the [[Bracing Knuckle Ring]] variants. Unlike most boss soul weapons, the Aged Smelter Sword cannot be infused.\n\n== Notes ==\n* Powerstancing the Smelter Sword with the Aged Smelter Sword allows for a large mixed red and blue explosion, dealing both fire and magic damage.\n* Like the regular Smelter Sword, the explosion of the special attack is only triggered if the player hits a solid object or enemy.\n{{clr}}\n\n==Moveset==\n{{Moveset\n|1hWeak = Horizontal swings\n|1hStrong = Overhead slam, weapon ignites in magic and performs a small magic explosion\n|2hWeak = Horizontal swings\n|2hStrong = A lunge, sword ignites in magic and lunges it at the enemy, creates a magic explosion\n|Jump = Leaps into the air and stabs the weapon onto the ground\n|Run = A small spin strike, a wide slash\n|2hRun = An uppercut that sends foes flying.
