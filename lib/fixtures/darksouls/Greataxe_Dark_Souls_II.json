It has the lowest [[Strength (Dark Souls II)|Strength]] requirement of the greataxes that have the heavy greataxe moveset, as well as the lowest [[weight]], making it much easier to wield for lower level builds. It has the highest [[durability]] of all the greataxe-class weapons, being tied with the [[Gyrm Greataxe]] at 80. Although the [[Drakekeeper's Greataxe]] has longer reach and better [[Parameter Bonus (Dark Souls II)|scaling]], the standard Greataxe is made available much earlier in the game and has the same moveset.\n{{Clr}}\n==Moveset==\n{{DaSIIMoveset\n|1hWeak   = Over-arm swings.\n|1hStrong = A slow over arm swing.\n|2hWeak   = A slow strong slash from left to right.\n|2hStrong = A slow over arm slash.\n|Jump     = A leaping vertical cleave. \n|Run      = A fast slash from left to right. \n|Roll     = A strong left to right slash\n|PSWeak   = \n|PSStrong = \n|Gbreak   = A standard guard break. \n|OhWeak   = Over-arm swings. \n|OhStrong = A slow over arm swing.\n}}\n\n{{DaSIIGreataxesNav}}\n{{Stub}}\n[[Category:Dark Souls II: Standard Weapons]]"
