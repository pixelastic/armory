All weapons must be collected on a single character.\n\nMost weapons can be collected in a single playthrough, but weapons crafted from [[:Category:Dark Souls: Boss Souls|boss souls]] can only be crafted once per playthrough. Most boss souls offer the option to create two different weapons, but the [[Soul of Sif]] can be used to create three different weapons, thus [[New Game Plus|New Game+2]] (a third playthrough)Â would be required to craft all possible variants. Weapons from the DLC ''[[Artorias of the Abyss]]'' are not required for this achievement/trophy.\n\nThe following is a list of weapons and their respective locations:\n==Boss Soul Weapons==\nThis list is roughly based on the order that the boss is encountered. Some important notes:\n*The base weapon must be upgraded to at least +10 before it can be ascended into a boss soul weapons.\n*Boss soul weapons can only be ascended at the [[Giant Blacksmith]] in [[Anor Londo]].\n*To gain the souls of [[Dragonslayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough|Ornstein and Smough]], they must be defeated in a different order in separate playthroughs.\n*The [[Soul of Sif]] is unique in that it is the only [[:Category:Dark Souls: Boss Souls|Boss Soul]] that is required to be obtained three times; one for each of the two [[Greatsword of Artorias]] variants, and one for the [[Greatshield of Artorias]].\n{| class=\"article-table rounded\"\n! scope=\"col\" |Weapon\n! scope=\"col\" |Soul\n! scope=\"col\" |Base Weapon\n|-\n|[[Crystal Ring Shield]]\n| colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\" |[[Soul of the Moonlight Butterfly]]\n|[[Shields|Shield]]\n|-\n|[[Moonlight Butterfly Horn]]\n|[[Spears|Spear]] or [[Thrusting Swords|Thrusting Sword]]\n|-\n|[[Chaos Blade]]\n| colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\" |[[Soul of Quelaag]]\n|[[Katanas|Katana]]\n|-\n|[[Quelaag's Furysword]]\n|[[Curved Swords|Curved Sword]]\n|-\n|[[Greatsword of Artorias]]\n| colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"3\" |[[Soul of Sif]]\n|[[Broken Straight Sword]] or [[Straight Sword Hilt]]\n|-\n|[[Greatsword of Artorias (Cursed)]]\n|[[Daggers|Dagger]], [[Greatswords (Dark Souls)|Greatsword]], or [[Straight Sword]]\n|-\n|[[Greatshield of Artorias]]\n|[[Shields|Shield]]\n|-\n|[[Dragon Bone Fist]]\n| colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\" |[[Core of an Iron Golem]]\n|[[Caestus]] or [[Claw]]\n|-\n|[[Golem Axe]]\n|[[Axes|Axe]]\n|-\n|[[Lifehunt Scythe]]\n|[[Soul of Priscilla]]\n|[[Halberds|Halberd]] or [[Whips|Whip]]\n|-\n|[[Dragonslayer Spear]]\n|[[Soul of Ornstein]]\n|[[Spears|Spear]] or [[Thrusting Swords|Thrusting Sword]]\n|-\n|[[Smough's Hammer]]\n|[[Soul of Smough]]\n|[[Hammers (Dark Souls)|Hammer]] or [[Great Hammers|Great Hammer]]\n|-\n|[[Darkmoon Bow]]\n| colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\" |[[Soul of Gwyndolin]]\n|[[Bows|Bow]]\n|-\n|[[Tin Darkmoon Catalyst]]\n|[[Catalysts|Catalyst]]\n|-\n| style=\"border-bottom:0;\" |[[Great Lord Greatsword]]\n| style=\"border-bottom:0;\" |[[Soul of Gwyn, Lord of Cinder]]\n| style=\"border-bottom:0;\" |[[Daggers|Dagger]], [[Greatswords (Dark Souls)|Greatsword]], or [[Straight Sword]]\n|}\n\n==Severed Tail Weapons==\nThese weapons are obtained by cutting the tail of certain enemies. You may only get one chance at most of these weapons until the next playthrough, as the enemies do not appear again, with the exception of the [[Bell Gargoyles|Gargoyles]] and the [[Stone Dragon]].\n\nIf a boss is about to die, and it seems unlikely the tail will be severed, quit the game and reload the save.
