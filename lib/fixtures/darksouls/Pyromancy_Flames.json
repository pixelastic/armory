They are unique amongst casting tools for the cheapness of upgrading them, in that only the cost of Souls needed to upgrade them increases; the player will only ever need one [[Fire Seed]] per upgrade. However, this is counterbalanced by the fact that Fire Seeds are found sporadically throughout the game.\n\n{{DaSIIWeaponTypeBox/Top | Pyromancy Flame\n}}\n{{DaSIIWeaponTypeBox/Row\n| name  = Pyromancy Flame (Dark Souls II) | name-display = Pyromancy Flame\n| image = Pyromancy Flame II.png\n| - | - | 125 | - | - | - | - | 100 | 5 | - | - | - | -\n| 25 | 5 | 30 | 20 | 20 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | - | - | - | A | - | -\n| stability = - | durability = 50 | weight = 0.0\n}}\n{{DaSIIWeaponTypeBox/Row\n| name  = Dark Pyromancy Flame\n| image = Dark Pyromancy Flame.png\n| - | - | 150 | - | - | - | - | 100 | 5 | - | - | - | -\n| 25 | 5 | 30 | 20 | 20 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | - | - | - | S | - | -\n| stability = - | durability = 60 | weight = 0.0\n}}\n{{DaSIIWeaponTypeBox/Bottom}}\n\n\n\n\n{{DaSIIWeaponsNav}}\n[[Category:Dark Souls II: Casting Tools]]\n[[Category:Dark Souls II: Pyromancy Flames]]"
