She continued the slaughter of the yuan-ti army until Kwan Ying herself appeared before her, arms open and eyes full of sympathy. \"If it will stop this slaughter, I will ease your pain and end your suffering.\"\n\n''\"I do not wish to end my suffering,\" replied Chin Yi. \"I wish for my fury to sound throughout the ages, now and forever.\" Wanting to help her servant, but not wishing to unleash such powerful fury on the world, Kwan Ying bound Chin Yi's spirit to the blade of the man she had failed to protect, and then hid the weapon in a warrior's tomb.

As the tale goes, the boastful Lilarcor left his village at the urging of his friends so that the \"great hero\" could do battle with a devious Treant. He walked for days in the dead of winter until, feverish, he found his target and began an epic wrestling match.  Unfortunately (or perhaps luckily), the \"Treant\" was nothing more than a craggy old normal oak. His friends had been jesting, not actually expecting that Lilarcor would go fight the fictitiously dangerous tree. That might have been the end of it, but Lilarcor, not really knowing what a Treant was in the first, didn't realize the truth. He eventually uprooted the oak and, marching proudly home, he declared himself a hero. Thus was born a laughing stock of epic proportions, and over time the name of Lilarcor became the sacrificial fool in many tales of \"less than brilliance\".It is not known whether this enchanted weapon is Lilarcor himself, perhaps imprisoned by an evil mage or some other odd coincidence of fate, but it certainly acts in a manner consistent with his level of competence. If it is he, he has never bemoaned his captivity. He might not realize, or care, that he is no longer a human.As a weapon, Lilarcor has its uses, but many a warrior has eventually given it away. Banter such as \"Ouch, that musta hurt\", \"Oh yeah!  Got 'im good\", and \"Beware my bite for it might...might...might really hurt or something\" is a constant barrage on a warrior's psyche.",

Libol, trapped in the armor but not certain of T'rachie's treachery asked to be sent to the wastes for a dangerous tour of duty against marauding ogres. He never returned and Baron T'rachie was free to pursue Libol's widow. This armor is cursed and requires powerful magic to remove.",
