This scrimshaw wand was the personal implement of the venerable chanter skald, Kaliwi the Storyteller. As a wandering lore keeper, Kaliwi traveled the islands of the Kingdom spreading tales of great heroes.\n\nKaliwi used this wand not only as a tool of defense from the ever-present dangers of the Deadfire, but to enhance her stories with vivid imagery, colors, and sounds - a technique she called \"weaving.\" She was especially fond of weaving her stories for children. To Kaliwi, the mind of a child was eager to believe in the unbelievable and find comfort in the fantastical. The greatest stories, after all, need not have necessarily happened to be true.\n\nA bit of illusory magic persists in the wand. When held, it whispers of tall tales, dazzling deeds, and the altogether extraordinary.",

Far from a game, this trial pitted the young dwarf against all the dangers of Naasitaq. She spent three weeks in the wild, battling endless blizzards and voracious beasts. Her bow was her only means of defense and subsistence.\n\nHer trial complete, Aamiina was trekking for home when she happened across a hungry frost drake stalking towards Blue Water village, using the storm to hide its approach. With no consideration for her own safety, Aamiina raised her horn and trumpeted a warning to the Blue Water warriors, who mobilized in time to fend off the beast.\n\nDenied its prize, the fearsome drake turned on Aamiina. The young huntress nocked and loosed, slaying the drake with a single arrow to the heart. Her bold actions secured her place among the matron huntresses that came before her.",

Among these was Azureith, a young Ovate.\n\nDeeply troubled by the use of the elements to turn nature against the people of Eir Glanfath, and wondering if he was seeing the last days of his people, Azureith took to walking the endless stretches of burned down forests in search of something, anything, that might signal a reason to hope. He found it in an old ironwood tree, thick and gnarled with roots that ran in waves through the ground as though they'd been woven there. It stood as it always had, though singed well up the side of its trunk now, while everything around it had been incinerated by the soldiers of Dyrwood, leaving a wasteland a thousand acres in every direction.\n\nAzureith plucked a single branch from the old tree (making sure to express his profound gratitude). An accomplished organic artificer, Azureith reshaped the branch into a blade that would rival any made in a forge. He infused it with the strength of the elements, vowing never again to be at their mercy, and resolving that if the tree could endure, so, too, could he.\n\nIn his hands, the blade would find its way into the hearts of many soldiers who stood at the edge of forests with torches and barrels of pitch, and by the war's end, he had saved many forests from the flame.\n\nWhen his years were drawing to a close, Azureith made a final pilgrimage back to the old ironwood tree, which still stood, and he laid the knife at its base, to be taken up by someone else in need of inspiration in dark times. On his way there, he was pleased to see that beneath the ashes that covered the forest floor, new life had begun to spring.\n\nAzureith's Stiletto is unusual as the entire weapon is dark red-brown wood, even the blade. The magic used in its creation hardened and protected the wood, preventing it from chipping or warping. Dark green vines and leaves sprout from it and wrap themselves around the hilt to form the grip.",

He was infamous among the encroaching soldiers of the Dyrwood for his rapid, daring raids into the hearts of their outposts, primarily under the cover of darkness. Badrwn's cloak, much like its former owner, is a practical thing. Dirt, moss, and blood have made the simple homespun garment into a mottled mosaic that seems to disappear amongst the rocks and trees. The frayed hem is silent, even when drawn over stone and dry leaves.\n\nWith the Glanfathan defeat and the end of the war, Badrwn and his most loyal followers made their way to the Deadfire, where they plundered merchant ships for many years. This cloak is all that remains of the fabled leader.",

Her crew and small cadre of paladins were outnumbered but not outmatched. They valiantly took the fight to their attackers but lost all initiative when the pirate's drake entered the fray. Only Samelia stood against the beast.\n\nThe enraged drake raked her across the breastplate, tearing it from her body and ripping steel and flesh. Mortally wounded, Samelia plunged her blade into the drake and pushed it back, forcing them both overboard. Her triumphant crew could only watch as their captain disappeared into the depths, her blade still embedded in the felled drake’s chest. On the deck, the paladin's ruined breastplate was all that remained of her.",

So he left Biageppe and, indeed, the Vailian Republics for fresh opportunities in the Living Lands, taking with him little more than his coin purse and a fresh change of smallclothes.\n\nUnfortunately, Antonino soon learned that the hardened treasure-hunters of the Living Lands were little like the plump merchants of the Republics. Within a few weeks, he'd exhausted his meager supplies and had earned nothing for his suffering. Desperate, he stumbled across a rough-looking pair from the Deadfire Archipelago and begged to share their fire. They agreed too easily.\n\nWhen the bandits made their move, Antonino was ready. He snatched the pistol from one and fired on the other. With the first attacker advancing, he pulled the trigger again only to hear a dull thud. While his assailant laughed, Antonino pulled back and struck the man's bald head with the pistol. The bandit collapsed, dead instantly.\n\nAntonino eventually became a successful and feared robber and the subject of many campfire tales. Even as his fortunes increased, he kept the stolen pistol, a sturdy piece of case-hardened metal that served him throughout his career.",

He would charge his enemies covered in blood with tears in his skin from hand to foot, and his foes would shrink at the sight of him, believing as he did that it was not in their power to injure such a man.\n\nNear the end of the rebellion, when the rebels had all but overthrown the government, Rugnfar found himself in a battle defending against St. Waidwen's main forces. Accounts claim that he was the last on his side to remain alive, and he was approached by St. Waidwen himself in the end. As the story goes, the living god looked him over and gave a slight bow, permitting him to fall upon his own blade, that he might remain free.\n\nThe armor bears many artificial scars added by the blacksmith to make its wearer as imposing as the figure who inspired it, though it wears its real scars with equal pride.",

Over the years the paladin slew countless heretics, but as time wore on his fervor slowly turned to fear at the unending evil he saw growing in his homeland. Tired of the myopic and ineffective approach of his superiors, the paladin swore to cleanse the corruption from the hearts of his people and took it upon himself to execute any who consorted with heathens. After finding a heretic hiding within a small village, the paladin put all its inhabitants to the sword for aiding the sinner. That night the paladin woke to his sword being driven through his own chest, having been betrayed by his own men, who were guilt-ridden for their own complicity in his atrocities. \n\nThis large sword seems to be covered in rust, but on closer inspection the brown stains on the blade are, in fact, dried blood. Apart from the size, the sword seems plain, its only ornamentation is hidden under the black leather wrapping on the ricasso, where an image of Woedica has been etched. Scratches on the etching indicate that someone once tried to clumsily remove it.",

The gifts were all the soft-hearted wizard could do to stanch his guilt..\n\nWandering from place to place with only her goat, her pike, and a reputation for negligence that preceded her, her fortunes changed one day when she encountered a pair of soldiers trapped by a group of bandits. Too short to wield the pike properly, she instead climbed atop her goat and spurred it into the fray, leveling the pike like a lance and running one of the bandits through. Frightened and confused by the display and intimidated by Jêna's coarse language, the remaining bandits fled, and the soldiers' lives were spared.\n\nHer actions earned her a commission with a local fort, and she served with distinction in the cavalry.

It is a land of plenty, and it is unknown whether those who find their way to the meadow are unable to leave or whether they simply choose not to.\n\nAt the center of the meadow, a place the peoples of Ixamitl regard as the center of Eora, grows a tree bearing small, red fruit.

When such a storm arrived, the wizard donned the cape and climbed to the spire atop his laboratory and called the lightning to himself. Seven lightning bolts struck the wizard simultaneously, throwing him from the spire to his sand garden below.

    "description": "This unsavory weapon has changed hands too many times to have an accurate account of its origin. The most agreed-upon legend attributes a Dyrwoodan shepherd and frequent tavern patron with its initial creation, but even this yarn tends to be told with slurred, ale-soured words. The only things truly known about the dagger are the contents of its construction - the rent, twisted remnants of a cheap, brass beer stein - and the dreadful effect it has on both its wielder and its victims. Pukestabber seems to bring out the worst qualities of a mean drunk, and mean drunks seem to be the only people who have ever carried it, though rarely for long. Unsurprisingly, such individuals tend to misplace or gamble away the weapon with alarming regularity, though it is most commonly taken by force after a drunken row or pointless barfight.",

    "description": "In a monastery overlooking Coldflow Lake from the foothills of the White March, there once resided a clandestine order of monks known as the Thousand Dreams. Through a powerful form of pain-induced meditation, these monks were able to walk through their past lives as though they were dreams. Each traversed these memories in ultimate hopes of achieving complete understanding of his or her soul's identity. They believed that after experiencing one thousand lifetimes, total enlightenment could be attained.\nGreatest of their sect was Rî Golan, who had an ancient soul and was said to have walked more lifetimes than any other. But when she came to the end of all her lifetimes and found there was more to experience, it became clear that she would never come to know herself completely, for there was simply not enough to learn from.\nUnable to accept this fate after her endless trials, Rî Golan sought a way to take the experiences of others for her own, that she might reach one thousand lifetimes yet. She channeled her unquenchable hunger into her favorite sword, and it became an instrument of her will. With it, she claimed many lives in the surrounding area. Each drop of blood on her blade was a new experience, each killing blow a new lifetime for her to claim.\nWhen the rest of the Thousand Dreams came to learn of her actions, they banded together and confronted Rî Golan upon her return to the temple. In the end, amid a courtyard of slain monks, she did indeed come to understand her soul, and it is said that among the many experiences contained in the blade are all those of Rî Golan herself.\nThe blade itself is a simple sabre with a worn leather grip and an inset ebony hilt. The sword becomes hot to the touch when its wielder's foes are vanquished.",

It is carved from what can only be a scale from the great adra dragon. Meticulous care was taken to fashion the wide, toothy mouth, which serves as the pipe's bowl. The small dragon seems to be both roaring and smiling, hungrily demanding to be packed and lit.\n\nThe pipe was the personal paraphernalia of Jehrelv the Addled, a wizard and animancer known not only for his love of whiteleaf, but also his obsession with its effects on the soul. His aloof and cruel nature led him to perform many questionable acts in his attempt to comprehend higher states of consciousness. He had a proclivity for stealing the souls of his associates and acquaintances, usually by inviting them to partake in poisoned potent whiteleaf. His victims would die and their souls, disoriented, would linger briefly. Jehrelv would then trap them in his favorite pipe. He always planned to conduct experiments on the souls of those who died in such a state, but often got distracted or just forgot.\n\nJehrelv came to a fitting end when, while not precisely in his right mind, he mistakenly smoked a batch of his own blighted whiteleaf and died. His spirit, confused, wandered into the pipe of its own volition, and has been unable to find its way out. It has plenty of company.",

As a result, the retaining nut had to be reinforced. Even a customized, enchanted windlass was needed to span the blasted thing. The stock itself was initially too weak for the whole operation and the wizard, ever a pragmatist, found structural enchantments were required to keep the weapon from snapping in two once armed.\n\nRunes etched into the massive, spearlike bolts helped them fly true and gave them the punch to puncture steel and flesh. However, the wizard found it took considerable expenditures of his own arcane powers to make them do so.

Its forked tip, undulating blade, and blue coloration made it a quick favorite among novices whose confidence often outpaced their skill.\n\nIt was most recently won by Matapa, a young woman from one of the wealthy aumaua families of Tongira. With the blade in hand, she declared to her parents that she would take Spelltongue and seek her fortune in Takowa as a duelist. Her parents attempted to dissuade her, but her resolve became clear, and they eventually offered their reluctant congratulations and threw a great feast in her honor.\n\nAfter Matapa had drunk her fill of wine and gorged herself on buttered lobster and sea snails in cream, her mother challenged her to a duel. Matapa laughed, but her mother promised her that, if she won, she would receive half of her family's fortune the next morning. If she lost, she would surrender Spelltongue without complaint. Matapa regarded her mother, a petite woman – by aumaua standards – with little combat experience. She accepted and the duel began, Matapa brandishing Spelltongue and her mother armed with a wooden practice sword.\n\nMatapa's mother was nimble, and Matapa's thrusts and ripostes were quick but sloppy. Her mother led her around the feast table and into the darkened courtyard, where Matapa tripped. Falling, Matapa ran Spelltongue through her mother's thigh even as the older woman held her wooden sword to the younger woman's neck. The onlookers declared the duel a tie, and Matapa received her inheritance at the cost of her prized sword. Matapa's parents quietly sold the blade to a merchant bound for Dyrwood, and Matapa, sobered by her loss, abandoned her ambitions as a duelist and instead became a successful playwright.",

A retired Aedyran privateer named Tarn Baeris discovered the blade by happenstance in a ruined watchtower on his estate in the Eastern Reach. When the emperor recalled Tarn to service during the War of Defiance, he took the weapon with him.\n\nTarn, no longer a young man, was not enthusiastic about returning to sea, but he served the empire resolutely. He was tasked with interdicting Vailian corsairs who were shipping supplies to rebels in the Dyrwood. An honorable man, Tarn elected to spare the ships and crews he captured after relieving them of their cargo. As such, he rarely found a cause to draw his blade.\n\nTarn's largess would be his undoing, however. Within the year he was killed under a flag of parley while negotiating terms. The corsair who slew him took Tarn's sabre as a trophy.",

    "description": "Saint Rumbalt was among the first of the Eothasian pilgrims to take up the Emperor's offer of resettlement in the distant territory of Readceras. A dedicated priest of the Shining God, Rumbalt was regarded as a leader in his community, known both for his unwavering dedication to his congregation and his stern vigilance against lapses in doctrine. What survives of his sermons reflects this duality, for he emphasized the redemptive power of the faith even as he warned against the dire punishments awaiting those who rejected Eothas' beneficence.\nThe colonization efforts brought Eothasian settlers into direct conflict with the native orlan populations, and Rumbalt was among those credited with routing several brutal attacks upon the settlement. Ultimately, however, Rumbalt was mortally wounded during a violent raid. Witnesses claimed that upon the moment of his death, Rumbalt's body was suffused by an overwhelming burst of light, knocking the remaining orlan warriors flat or else scattering them back into the forest. Accounts arose of Rumbalt's final hours, describing the great miracles which were observed to have occurred during the day preceding his death. Eothas, it was said, had informed Rumbalt of his fate, and the priest accepted this gladly and without fear, for he knew that death was only the first step in his rebirth. He subsequently marked each of his final 27 hours with a miraculous act, such that his congregation would know of the gift Eothas had bestowed upon him, and continue Rumbalt's work in his stead.\nRather than stanch the flow of Eothasian settlers, Rumbalt's death only encouraged more pilgrims to venture across the sea, eager to set their eyes upon the final resting place of Eothas' favored servant. The Hours of Saint Rumbalt was forged in dedication to this patron saint of the resettlement, and its blade is inscribed with markings counting the 27 hours before Rumbalt's passing. In such manner was the blade imbued with the saint's power. It was said that a man might kneel before the sword and know with precision the moment of his death.",

    "description": "This slender steel scepter is topped with a gilded, feminine hand, each finger ending in a delicate mother-of-pearl nail. It was forged and crafted by the smiths and artisans of Delwin, a small town in the foothills of the Magmear Mountains in the southern reaches of the Aedyr Empire. The recipient was Lady Ryga Adalwan, 3rd Margréfa of Maghanon, who had recently emerged victorious from a brutal campaign against her march by barbarians and agents of a rival family. In leading the defense of the march, Lady Ryga had lost her left hand. The emperor had this scepter created to reward her sacrifice during the protection of what was then the empire's southernmost territory.\n\nUnfortunately for the Adalwan family, they only held the Maghanon territories for two more generations. With little money and no land, the family set out for the young colonies of the Dyrwood. The Lady's Hand saw renewed use in battle by Branon Adalwan, Thayn of the Low Meadows, during the War of Black Trees. There, Branon used it to defeat Glanfathan warriors and spirit-animated trees that were marching out of the deep woods. For his service to the colonies, Branon was made an erl of the new territory of Blackstand. But bad luck struck the Adalwan family twice. Only a year after establishing a fort on the frontier, Branon was ambushed by Glanfathan resistance fighters. Finishing their main mission, the assassins then pursued his small family and killed every member, leaving no heirs to the house of Adalwan.\n\nFollowing the reinforcement of Blackstand's fort by its new erl, the Adalwan family's belongings were distributed according to the known wishes of Branon. Notably, the Lady's Hand, his great-great grandmother's gift from the emperor, was bequeathed to Sir Hareg Kardaf, a minor knight of New Heomar, alongside whom Branon had fought in the War of Black Trees. More comfortable with sword and shield than scepter and grimoire, Sir Hareg displayed his friend's gift prominently in his home, but it never saw use in battle again.",

Among the crowd was none other than Traria Salagna, the head of the Salagna clan and a brazenly corrupt bureaucrat.

While it complicated the shot, it would not save Traria. Devio took aim and fired. The slug punched through the three brass bells, sounding a chime that drowned out the gun's report. The crowd, startled by the sudden cacophony, watched in horror as the Salagna matriarch fell dead, shot cleanly through the heart.",

Just as one of the beasts picked up his scent, a delemgan stepped out of the copse and in front of the blacksmith.\nThe stelgaers soon lost interest, and when the blacksmith had recovered from his terror, he thanked the delemgan, Vierina, and begged to know how he could express his gratitude. Thrice she bade him forget about her and continue on his way, but seeing the man's zeal, she finally relented.\n\"Enemies encroach on my wood,\" she said. \"Bring me a means of defending it.\" The blacksmith swore that he'd return with a worthy gift and so departed. Weeks later, he forged a dagger and sought her in the forest. She saw the gift and smiled sadly.\n\"A noble attempt, yet I fear it would do little to clear the foes that spring up in my midst. Please, return home and know that you have my thanks for your efforts.\" But the blacksmith shook his head and, over her protests, promised to bring her a suitable gift.\nAfter months behind the forge, he'd crafted several fine battle axes, and he brought the best of these to Vienna. Even her graciousness did not conceal the horror on her face. \"Surely my enemies would seize this and turn it against me and my forest. Please, go to your village and forget about this.\" But, deaf to her objections, he vowed to try again.\nSo the blacksmith devoted a year to crafting the finest, sharpest spearheads any had seen. People came from near and far to purchase the very weapons that he had crafted, finished, and deemed unworthy of Vierina. And as his reputation grew, so did the village around him. After a year of labor, he returned to the forest with the finest spear any had ever seen. The wilds seemed to have dwindled, and finding her was no easy task When he eventually did, he presented the spear. \"A weapon worthy of you,\" he said. \"Long enough that none may snatch it from your grasp.\"\nBut she recoiled from the wooden pole. \"I could not defend myself with the bones of my own felled trees. I beg you, go and do not return.\" Yet he made an oath to bring her a final gift to fit her purposes.\nAfter years of work, he crafted the finest rapier in the land, its blade as narrow and fine as a needled leaf. In that time, the sale of his lesser attempts had made him a wealthy man, and his village had grown to a small city. When he returned to the forest a final time, he hardly recognized it. The sprawling woodlands had been whittled to a few scrabby thickets, and Vienna was nowhere to be found.

Such was her belligerence that Aedhor took to wearing a thick glove to pet the hound.\n\nEven as the hound aged her temper never waned, though her health diminished. Near the end she lacked the strength to do more than muster a pitiful snarl. Aedhor knew her days were numbered.

She sailed the winds in the days before the coming of Engwith, taking the form of a bird to hunt the foes of the aumaua, alighting on high promontories, and raining arrows on her quarry from above. When a great kraken assaulted a flotilla, she blinded it with two deft shots, then leapt among its thrashing arms, slicing through rubbery flesh and staining the sea with ink and blood.\n\nSome say she perished that day.

During that time, many of the fiercest conflicts flared up along the edge of the Cythwood, where the two powers shared a border.\nThe Cythwood elves used the jungle terrain to their advantage and quickly became infamous for their cunning and brutal tactics. Skirmishers would fell trees behind invading Aedyran forces while druids made more to grow in their path, confusing and stalling their foes. They would often pair these maneuvers with devastating, lightning-fast attacks, surrounding lost platoons and dragging stragglers into the forest. Most notoriously, they would hang their victims from the trees to warn off further attacks.\nThe Kulklin of the Cythwood were swift and improvised attacks quickly, owing in part to their use of everyday tools – axes, knives, and bows – as weapons of war. Axes such as Wodewys would have been used against folk and tree alike.",
