    "description": "The War of Black Trees brought hardship and suffering to many Glanfathans, but it bore special tragedy for its druidic orders, who were forced not only to endure the deaths of many friends and kin, but also the destruction of the lands they revered above all else. Among these was Azureith, a young Ovate.\n\nDeeply troubled by the use of the elements to turn nature against the people of Eir Glanfath, and wondering if he was seeing the last days of his people, Azureith took to walking the endless stretches of burned down forests in search of something, anything, that might signal a reason to hope. He found it in an old ironwood tree, thick and gnarled with roots that ran in waves through the ground as though they'd been woven there. It stood as it always had, though singed well up the side of its trunk now, while everything around it had been incinerated by the soldiers of Dyrwood, leaving a wasteland a thousand acres in every direction.\n\nAzureith plucked a single branch from the old tree (making sure to express his profound gratitude). An accomplished organic artificer, Azureith reshaped the branch into a blade that would rival any made in a forge. He infused it with the strength of the elements, vowing never again to be at their mercy, and resolving that if the tree could endure, so, too, could he.\n\nIn his hands, the blade would find its way into the hearts of many soldiers who stood at the edge of forests with torches and barrels of pitch, and by the war's end, he had saved many forests from the flame.\n\nWhen his years were drawing to a close, Azureith made a final pilgrimage back to the old ironwood tree, which still stood, and he laid the knife at its base, to be taken up by someone else in need of inspiration in dark times. On his way there, he was pleased to see that beneath the ashes that covered the forest floor, new life had begun to spring.\n\nAzureith's Stiletto is unusual as the entire weapon is dark red-brown wood, even the blade. The magic used in its creation hardened and protected the wood, preventing it from chipping or warping. Dark green vines and leaves sprout from it and wrap themselves around the hilt to form the grip.",

He knelt on the stone floor of his temple and prayed for five days straight, forsaking food, water, and sleep for the sake of his vigil. On the evening of the fifth day, he fell into an exhausted slumber and dreamt that the Pallid Knight told him to restore the cycle by returning the souls of the living to it. When he awoke, he found a large but plain candlestick from the temple altar lying next to his hand.\n\nHe fashioned the candlestick into a weapon, and he prowled the city, murdering the elderly and the infirm in Berath's name. As the death toll climbed into the dozens, a mob of the vengeful and bereaved formed to track him down. They caught up with the cleric outside his temple and turned his own weapon on him, bashing his skull apart in the streets. Several onlookers claimed to see an elderly dwarf, cloaked and impossibly emaciated, standing in the shadows and laughing.",

A dedicated priest of the Shining God, Rumbalt was regarded as a leader in his community, known both for his unwavering dedication to his congregation and his stern vigilance against lapses in doctrine. What survives of his sermons reflects this duality, for he emphasized the redemptive power of the faith even as he warned against the dire punishments awaiting those who rejected Eothas' beneficence.\nThe colonization efforts brought Eothasian settlers into direct conflict with the native orlan populations, and Rumbalt was among those credited with routing several brutal attacks upon the settlement. Ultimately, however, Rumbalt was mortally wounded during a violent raid. Witnesses claimed that upon the moment of his death, Rumbalt's body was suffused by an overwhelming burst of light, knocking the remaining orlan warriors flat or else scattering them back into the forest. Accounts arose of Rumbalt's final hours, describing the great miracles which were observed to have occurred during the day preceding his death. Eothas, it was said, had informed Rumbalt of his fate, and the priest accepted this gladly and without fear, for he knew that death was only the first step in his rebirth. He subsequently marked each of his final 27 hours with a miraculous act, such that his congregation would know of the gift Eothas had bestowed upon him, and continue Rumbalt's work in his stead.\nRather than stanch the flow of Eothasian settlers, Rumbalt's death only encouraged more pilgrims to venture across the sea, eager to set their eyes upon the final resting place of Eothas' favored servant. The Hours of Saint Rumbalt was forged in dedication to this patron saint of the resettlement, and its blade is inscribed with markings counting the 27 hours before Rumbalt's passing. In such manner was the blade imbued with the saint's power. It was said that a man might kneel before the sword and know with precision the moment of his death.",

It was forged and crafted by the smiths and artisans of Delwin, a small town in the foothills of the Magmear Mountains in the southern reaches of the Aedyr Empire. The recipient was Lady Ryga Adalwan, 3rd Margréfa of Maghanon, who had recently emerged victorious from a brutal campaign against her march by barbarians and agents of a rival family. In leading the defense of the march, Lady Ryga had lost her left hand. The emperor had this scepter created to reward her sacrifice during the protection of what was then the empire's southernmost territory.\n\nUnfortunately for the Adalwan family, they only held the Maghanon territories for two more generations. With little money and no land, the family set out for the young colonies of the Dyrwood. The Lady's Hand saw renewed use in battle by Branon Adalwan, Thayn of the Low Meadows, during the War of Black Trees. There, Branon used it to defeat Glanfathan warriors and spirit-animated trees that were marching out of the deep woods. For his service to the colonies, Branon was made an erl of the new territory of Blackstand. But bad luck struck the Adalwan family twice. Only a year after establishing a fort on the frontier, Branon was ambushed by Glanfathan resistance fighters. Finishing their main mission, the assassins then pursued his small family and killed every member, leaving no heirs to the house of Adalwan.\n\nFollowing the reinforcement of Blackstand's fort by its new erl, the Adalwan family's belongings were distributed according to the known wishes of Branon. Notably, the Lady's Hand, his great-great grandmother's gift from the emperor, was bequeathed to Sir Hareg Kardaf, a minor knight of New Heomar, alongside whom Branon had fought in the War of Black Trees. More comfortable with sword and shield than scepter and grimoire, Sir Hareg displayed his friend's gift prominently in his home, but it never saw use in battle again.",

An important Glanfathan landmark, Dev Clef was the site of a brutal battle between the Glanfathans and Dyrwoodans during the tumultuous period before the Ten Years' Treaties were signed. The crags and caves along the cliffs provided the Glanfathans with plentiful cover from which to stage their attacks against Dyrwoodan forces, allowing them to duck out of sight the moment a threat emerged. Given this natural advantage, the Glanfathans succeeded in driving the Dyrwoodans from the region.",

He issued a mandate that any visiting sailors at port that did not conduct their business peaceably and depart with the tides would ﬁnd themselves subject to his own mercenary justice.

The wheel of his wagon broke and he had to make camp and repair it. During the night, a pack of hunting stelgaers ventured into his encampment, and he hid among the trees. Just as one of the beasts picked up his scent, a delemgan stepped out of the copse and in front of the blacksmith.\nThe stelgaers soon lost interest, and when the blacksmith had recovered from his terror, he thanked the delemgan, Vierina, and begged to know how he could express his gratitude. Thrice she bade him forget about her and continue on his way, but seeing the man's zeal, she finally relented.\n\"Enemies encroach on my wood,\" she said. \"Bring me a means of defending it.\" The blacksmith swore that he'd return with a worthy gift and so departed. Weeks later, he forged a dagger and sought her in the forest. She saw the gift and smiled sadly.\n\"A noble attempt, yet I fear it would do little to clear the foes that spring up in my midst. Please, return home and know that you have my thanks for your efforts.\" But the blacksmith shook his head and, over her protests, promised to bring her a suitable gift.\nAfter months behind the forge, he'd crafted several fine battle axes, and he brought the best of these to Vienna. Even her graciousness did not conceal the horror on her face. \"Surely my enemies would seize this and turn it against me and my forest. Please, go to your village and forget about this.\" But, deaf to her objections, he vowed to try again.\nSo the blacksmith devoted a year to crafting the finest, sharpest spearheads any had seen. People came from near and far to purchase the very weapons that he had crafted, finished, and deemed unworthy of Vierina. And as his reputation grew, so did the village around him. After a year of labor, he returned to the forest with the finest spear any had ever seen. The wilds seemed to have dwindled, and finding her was no easy task When he eventually did, he presented the spear. \"A weapon worthy of you,\" he said. \"Long enough that none may snatch it from your grasp.\"\nBut she recoiled from the wooden pole. \"I could not defend myself with the bones of my own felled trees. I beg you, go and do not return.\" Yet he made an oath to bring her a final gift to fit her purposes.\nAfter years of work, he crafted the finest rapier in the land, its blade as narrow and fine as a needled leaf. In that time, the sale of his lesser attempts had made him a wealthy man, and his village had grown to a small city. When he returned to the forest a final time, he hardly recognized it. The sprawling woodlands had been whittled to a few scrabby thickets, and Vienna was nowhere to be found. He returned once again to his forge and spent the rest of his days making rapiers to wreak vengeance upon Vierina's unknown tormentors.",

He was indiscriminate in his violence, preying on merchants and other pirates alike in his quest for treasure and blood.\n\nThe ships of his many victims were often discovered adrift, their decks littered with corpses and the riggings strewn with severed heads. Driven only by his insatiable need to spill blood, Daneric eventually began to forgo even plundering the vessels. As his infamy grew, entire flotillas set sail with the express purpose of hunting down the Claret and her captain.\n\nDaneric’s crew, dissatisfied with a lack of loot and disillusioned with Daneric’s malevolent deeds, eventually sold him out to Vailian pirate hunters in exchange for clemency and a sizeable bounty. When the Vailians boarded, Daneric’s crew turned on their captain.\n\nSalvagers later discovered the Claret floating adrift. The headless bodies of both crews covered the deck. Neither the Vailian frigate nor Captain Daneric were anywhere to be found.",

Instead ornate, arcane symbols on the hammer and frizzen provide the necessary ignition for the primer. This \"runelock,\" as Rufus called it, is effective and reliable. Dragon's Dowry fires lead balls wreathed in fire. When loaded with rune powder it can belch forth a torrent of pure flame.\n\nUnfortunately, the unstable magics that provide such power are unpredictable. On occasion hot powder can blow backwards upon firing, burning the shooter. Rufus saw this not as a drawback of his creation but as a just offering to Magran. The burns that pocked his cheeks, hands, and arms were symbols of his penitence and his god’s good favor.",

Purportedly it was crafted by Rufus Aechmont, the sect's most venerable weaponsmith. While the weapon was still glowing red from the forge, Rufus is said to have begged Magran to bless the weapon and its creator. When Rufus quenched the weapon, the oil ignited, badly injuring Rufus and burning his smithy to the ground. While later searching the rubble, Rufus claimed to have recovered the axe head, still red-hot. The blade never cooled, a sure sign of Magran's favor.",

The wizard's initial experiments were promising - the garment seemed to absorb and redirect the effects of the wizard's most potent lightning spells. After countless self-administered shocks he was left no worse for wear, save for a few burns and a persistent nervous twitch that intensified with his proximity to metal objects.\n\nEver a perfectionist, the enchanter was unsatisfied with his limited data. Simple spells were insufficient. He needed to pit the cape against the fury of a proper storm. When such a storm arrived, the wizard donned the cape and climbed to the spire atop his laboratory and called the lightning to himself. Seven lightning bolts struck the wizard simultaneously, throwing him from the spire to his sand garden below. There was a brilliant flash upon impact that turned the sand to glass and set his arboretum aflame. Broken and concussed, but very much alive, the enchanter praised his experiment as a resounding success.",

This provided no shortage of obstacles in its initial construction. The wizard found he need to strengthen the bow lathes to accommodate the oversized bolts. Thus, a heavier string was required. As a result, the retaining nut had to be reinforced. Even a customized, enchanted windlass was needed to span the blasted thing. The stock itself was initially too weak for the whole operation and the wizard, ever a pragmatist, found structural enchantments were required to keep the weapon from snapping in two once armed.\n\nRunes etched into the massive, spearlike bolts helped them fly true and gave them the punch to puncture steel and flesh. However, the wizard found it took considerable expenditures of his own arcane powers to make them do so. In the end, the weapon, while powerful, seemed only of use to those with sufficient knowledge of arcana. As such, the wizard abandoned his plans to produce similar weapons en masse and kept this prototype for his personal use.",

In an effort to organize her ever growing supply of arcane scrolls, she needed a safe, secure place to keep them. Considering the sheer volume of scrolls in her admittedly horde-like collection, this safe place needed to be essentially infinite in size but small enough to be handy. A few experimental enchantments later, she created just that. One by one, over the course of many weeks, she tucked each and every scroll she owned into the folds and loops of her spellkeeper belt. Unfortunately, the scrolls never seemed to come out of the belt in the same order she put them in. In her opinion, this seemed a small price to pay for the peace of mind afforded by a well-organized home.",

Her victories mounted and she led her cohort of militant faithful until the battle of Halgot Citadel, where the Godhammer ended her crusade in a blast of metal and stone. Waidwen was gone. Later, before her capture, Kaethys was seen searching the debris as her troops fled. Her cape was nowhere to be seen.",

Lurkers and forest sprites would have seen an unarmed woodcutter as easy prey, so the hatchet served both as a tool and weapon for defense. The axe is well-suited to lumbering. The runes stamped into the head are a bane to all plants. Vines and branches retreat from its presence, and a single stroke is enough to split timber.",

The animancer, by her own words, was terrified for the fate of her soul, and dreaded the idea of her essence being ground into the Wheel and returned to the world. To forestall what she saw as her ultimate demise, she created a black, skein steel great sword with which to harvest the soul energies of others, invigorating her life essence. The blade, however, exacted a toll on its creator, leading to her inevitable death. While powerful, it demands the life force of those who wield it.",

If he was rumored to be fighting, opposing commanders would actively bid for his loyalty throughout the course of the melee.\n\nMaoalahua was indiscriminate in battle - striking all who came near, both friend and foe. He could be relied on to never give ground, however, and his \"allies\" always gave him a wide berth in which to do his deadly work.",

He confided in those close to him that he thought the spirits of the dead were speaking to him through the blade while he slept.\n\nOne evening, against the pleas of his wife and soldiers, a maddened Cafed carried the sword deep into the misty woods of Eir Glanfath. His body was never recovered, but the next Roadwarden the erl assigned to Caed Nua found it waiting for him on the throne in the keep's great hall. None of the soldiers could explain how the sword had appeared there. No Roadwarden has carried the sword since that day.",
