She continued the slaughter of the yuan-ti army until Kwan Ying herself appeared before her, arms open and eyes full of sympathy. \"If it will stop this slaughter, I will ease your pain and end your suffering.\"\n\n''\"I do not wish to end my suffering,\" replied Chin Yi. \"I wish for my fury to sound throughout the ages, now and forever.\" Wanting to help her servant, but not wishing to unleash such powerful fury on the world, Kwan Ying bound Chin Yi's spirit to the blade of the man she had failed to protect, and then hid the weapon in a warrior's tomb. The tomb was later infiltrated and the weapon stolen, and although Chin Yi's cries could no longer be heard through the steel of the blade, her vengeance was as brutal as ever.''",

It was in this tear that a group of bandit orcs allegdly kidnapped and killed a Tethyrian noblewoman, and the response from authorities was genocidal slaughter of orcs throughout the south in her memory. Krotan mounted a defense that ensured his people were not entirely destroyed; though they were displaced. Krotan himself fell near the end of the conflict, and his head was mounted outside the graveyard where the young lady was buried. As a point of interest, orc's called this time the \"Year of Pushing Too Far.\"",

A nearby wizard, Galloma discovered the youth and found in him a kindred soul. The two fast became friends; master and apprentice. Galloma died before Dramnek's tutorage could be completed however and the youth found himself once more alone in the world.  Eventually he made his way to the streets of Athkatla. There he became a cutpurse, augmenting his thieving skills with the little magic he'd learned from Galloma.  Eventually he crafted this sword, which enhanced Dramnek's weak physical body.

As the tale goes, the boastful Lilarcor left his village at the urging of his friends so that the \"great hero\" could do battle with a devious Treant. He walked for days in the dead of winter until, feverish, he found his target and began an epic wrestling match.  Unfortunately (or perhaps luckily), the \"Treant\" was nothing more than a craggy old normal oak. His friends had been jesting, not actually expecting that Lilarcor would go fight the fictitiously dangerous tree. That might have been the end of it, but Lilarcor, not really knowing what a Treant was in the first, didn't realize the truth. He eventually uprooted the oak and, marching proudly home, he declared himself a hero. Thus was born a laughing stock of epic proportions, and over time the name of Lilarcor became the sacrificial fool in many tales of \"less than brilliance\".It is not known whether this enchanted weapon is Lilarcor himself, perhaps imprisoned by an evil mage or some other odd coincidence of fate, but it certainly acts in a manner consistent with his level of competence. If it is he, he has never bemoaned his captivity. He might not realize, or care, that he is no longer a human.As a weapon, Lilarcor has its uses, but many a warrior has eventually given it away. Banter such as \"Ouch, that musta hurt\", \"Oh yeah!  Got 'im good\", and \"Beware my bite for it might...might...might really hurt or something\" is a constant barrage on a warrior's psyche.",

Specially commissioned by Bolhur \"Thunderaxe\" at GREAT expense, this suit was his most prized, even if not his most ornate.

By \"hampering\" he did not just mean in movement or weight: his ideal suit should be able to withstand the rigors of his wanderings with little maintenance. This is not to say that Bolhur \"Thunderaxe\" neglected his armors (to say as such would get your ears boxed) but the regime of spit and polish required for a \"gentleman's\" suit was beyond his caring. Save the tassels and gilding of Full Plate for kings and heads of state; a working dwarf cares more of utility than looks.",

Sickened of his enslavement, Bala crept into the mage's lair and cracked the elf's skull open.

It is obvious from poor craftmanship that Bala crafted the axe. The mystery lies in where its power originates. After a lenghty career of mage-slaying, Bala died, never having revealed his secret to those who were willing to risk a lice infestation by approaching him.
